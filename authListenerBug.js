The issue arises when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener in conjunction with asynchronous operations within the listener's callback function.  The problem stems from the fact that the asynchronous operation might not complete before the listener triggers again, leading to race conditions or unexpected behavior.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to fetch user data from a Firestore collection after successful authentication. If the data fetching operation is slow, the `onAuthStateChanged` listener may fire again before the data fetching is complete, leading to stale data or overwritten results. This can manifest in unexpected UI behavior or incorrect data processing.
