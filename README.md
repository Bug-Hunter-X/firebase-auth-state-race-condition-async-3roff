# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener along with asynchronous operations. The example showcases a race condition where the asynchronous task (fetching user data) might not complete before the listener triggers again, leading to incorrect data processing.

The `authListenerBug.js` file illustrates the problematic scenario.  The solution, provided in `authListenerSolution.js`, demonstrates how to properly handle asynchronous operations within the listener to prevent race conditions and ensure accurate data handling.
